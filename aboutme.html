        <p class="aboutMe"">
        Hello world.  My name is Jourdan, I'm an aspiring full-stack developer and cyber security specialist.
        Programming is a passion I found during lockdown.  I began creating Minecraft mods with Java in March of 2020
        (don't ask to see them they weren't very good) and ever since I've been hooked.  I love the freedom, creativity,
        and problem solving that coding and programming have to offer.  I hope to one day be the CTO or CISO of a successful
        company, or to pave my own path and start my own business.  Or maybe both.  
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="aboutMe">
        I discovered a passion for cyber security a few months ago after doing some digging into how I wanted
        to pursue programming career wise.  It's an intriguing field that keeps you on your toes and that's just what I'm looking
        for.
